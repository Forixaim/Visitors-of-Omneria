# Visitors from Omneria - Battle Arts and ExCap

"Well... Here is the inevitable mod split. Imagine Battle Arts being base Epic Fight. This is the WoM of Battle Arts." 

WARNING: Most weapons created here are unforgivably strong, which can scale off from other mods, and have some of the craziest combo routes.

## All Battle Styles from Visitors of Omneria have the following.

Jab - The auto attacks

Tilts - Directional m1 attacks

Smash Attacks - Innate Skills but they can be spammed, also directional.

Aerials - Jump attacks are boring, let's make proper aerial attacks, directional as well.

Combat Arts - The lifeblood of Battle Arts

Burst Arts - Powerful burst modes you can tap into.

Ultimate Arts - Extremely powerful, once per battle, near instakill attempt on your foes.

You can meet 10 legendary warriors called the "Omnerian Cosmonians" along the journey and additional villains down the path.

Currently, the 1st Omnerian Cosmonian is: The Imperatrice Lumiere - Charlemagne Halphas Flaron

The current battle style being worked on is: Imperatrice Lumiere
